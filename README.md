Machine Learning algorithms I implemented from scratch back in 2014/2015 in MATLAB
These include: 
a. Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)
b. Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)
c. Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
There are numerous algorithms implemented for the purpose of understand the underlying Calculus and Algebra principles as well as case studies and applications (mart robots, text understanding such as web search and anti-spam, computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas).
